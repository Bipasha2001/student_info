This project aims to develop a comprehensive Student Information System (SIS) for educational institutions. It will include features such as user authentication, student profile management, enrollment, attendance tracking, grading, communication tools, reporting, and analytics. Technologies like Java, Python, HTML/CSS, Spring Boot, Django, React.js, and various databases will be used. The system will automate tasks, improve data accuracy and security, enhance communication, and provide valuable insights for decision-making.
